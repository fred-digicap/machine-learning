Real Housing Pricing - Example with Demodata by sklearn
The Task
For that example a dataset by sklearn is used: the Boston House Dataset. The goal is to be able
to make a price prediction of a house and to determine the factors on which the price depends.

This includes visualizations using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries

First things first: The Result:
Dependencies in this case: ‘INDUS’, ‘NOX’, ‘RM’, ‘TAX’, ‘PTRATIO’, ‘LSTAT’ (The description
of that is below)
Here are 5 Samples:
PREDICTION: 25.17 // REAL: 23.8 // DIFFERENCE: 1.37
PREDICTION: 22.31 // REAL: 19.3 // DIFFERENCE: 3.01
PREDICTION: 12.51 // REAL: 7.2 // DIFFERENCE: 5.31
PREDICTION: 32.52 // REAL: 33.1 // DIFFERENCE: -0.58
PREDICTION: 23.62 // REAL: 24.0 // DIFFERENCE: -0.38
